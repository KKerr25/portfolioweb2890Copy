TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

1: Changed the theme colors to reflect a more trustable website, this also
   helped with seeing the contrast in the colors, giving the website a more accesible look.

2: Changed the button hover effect. Instead of applying the gradient
   which I had thought was a little much on the eyes I instead 
   applied a much smoother transition that is more visually pleasing.

3: Changed the size and motion of the waves in the introduction segment. I did this beacuse
   I figured this may be a thing that other students may look over and might make
   my site look more unique.

4: Changed The Services section to an About me section. With this I channged the
 information to represent my life and what skills I have obtained. I also 
 changed the icons to more accurately represent the story I am trying
 to tell.

5. Changed the "CAMPANIES" section into an Employer/Educator section.
    this secton just serves as a representation for both, the company where I am
    actively employed. Aswell as the college I am attending.

6. Removed the TESTIONIAL section. However, I kept the container for it
 as I thought It could serve as a smooth transition into the next part of
 the website.
 
7. Completely removed the FAQ section. This was a section I saw that I hadn't
any use for. It would be hard to put such section in a portfolio website.

8. Turned the "Latest Work" section into a collage of photos of me. I did
this to give whoever may be looking at my portfolio a better idea of what
I look like, aswell as what my life looks like.

9. Revised the "Start your project" section into a Contact me section. This way
whoever sees my portfolio can contact me via leaving their phone number and email.
aswell as a message.

10. Revised the footer to provide accurate information about contacting me.
removed the social media icons. This is because I did not provide any information 
about my social media. I felt as if my phone # and email were enough.
